# Heritable-traits-separating-lean-and-siscowet
R scripts and data associated with the manuscript titled: Further evidence from common garden rearing experiments of heritable traits separating lean and siscowet lake charr (Salvelinus namaycusch) ecotypes.

__Cross_phenotype_differences.Rmd:__ This file includes statistics and plots used for the phenotypic analysis reported in the manuscript. 

__RDA_lakeTrout_forSupplementals.Rmd:__ This file includes statistics and plots used for the RDA and candidate loci analysis reported in the manuscript.

__TankEffects_lakeTrout_forSupplementals.Rmd:__ This file includes statistics and plots used for the tests conducted to determiine whether Tank substantially influenced phenotype results.

__rqtl_file_formater.R__ and __rqtl_analysis_3-10-21.R:__ These files include the basic pipeline used to translate RADseq alignments to the Lake Trout Linkage Map reported in Smith et al., 2020. 


NOTE: These scripts are meant as to proved open access to analysis conducted the manuscript _Further evidence from common garden rearing experiments of heritable traits separating lean and siscowet lake charr (Salvelinus namaycusch) ecotypes_. Each dataset is different and therefore caution should be used when cross-applying these analyses to a novel study.
